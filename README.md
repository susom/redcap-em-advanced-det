# Advanced DET

This external module allows you to configure more than one DET url along with some other hoops and whistles.

## DET Logic
You can configure a DET to only trigger if certain logic has been met.  This can cut down on the amount of traffic to your web-service

## Mass DET:
Have you ever wanted to 'reprocess' all of your records with a DET?  This can happen if you fix an issue with your DET web service or if you have just done a bulk upload of data to your REDCap project.  Now, you can goto the Advanced DET page on your project and easily re-process all or a subset of records.
